# 🎓 Exploratory Data Analysis of Higher Education in Russia

📊 **Dataset**: [Russia’s Education System – Full Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergeistanislavovich/russias-education-system-full-data)

## 📌 Introduction
Higher education is a key driver of economic development, social mobility, and workforce preparedness. This project explores the trends and dynamics of higher education in Russia using a dataset I personally compiled from official public sources. It covers tuition costs, funding structures, regional disparities, and economic influences on education accessibility.

## 🔍 Why This Analysis Matters
Understanding these patterns helps:
- Policymakers improve education access and funding strategies
- Universities optimize resources and program offerings
- Students make smarter, data-informed choices

## 📊 Key Focus Areas
- **Affordability & Accessibility**: How costs affect students across regions
- **Economic Influence**: Role of inflation and pricing dynamics
- **Regional Disparities**: Where and why access varies
- **State-Funded vs. Paid Education**: Changing trends in financing
- **Exploratory Relationships**: Correlations, time-lags, and deeper patterns

## 🧠 Final Insights

### 💰 Rising Costs of Education
- Tuition fees rising sharply, especially in private universities  
- Inflation has spiked post-2021, but *real* costs (adjusted for inflation) are flat or declining

### 📉 Demand Shifts
- Fewer science grads since 2017, major drop in 2020  
- IT and nanotech fields growing in popularity  
- State-funded spots are shrinking, while self-funded enrollment grows

### 🌍 Regional Disparities
- Central and Ural districts lead in enrollment  
- North Caucasus and Far East lag behind, partly due to student migration  
- Student numbers correlate strongly with population size

### 🎓 Study Preferences
- Full-time education remains dominant  
- Part-time and blended learning vary widely across regions

### 📊 Fees vs. Enrollment
- Lower tuition = more students, especially in public universities  
- No strong link between rising tuition and fee-paying student numbers
